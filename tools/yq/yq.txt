**Description**
There seems to be no way to inplace a YAML for a multiple YAML document.
Such as while using the select `documentIndex`.

**Example**
For a given yaml file, data.yml:
```yaml
---
key1: value1
---
key2: value2
```
Running the command:
```
yq -i 'select(documentIndex == 1) |.key3="value3"' data.yml
```

**Actual behavior**
```yaml
---
key2: value2
key3: value3
```

**Expected behavior**
```yaml
---
key1: value1
---
key2: value2
key3: value3
```

**Potential Work Around**
Split the yaml, inplace the second yaml then merge. However, this is tedious the more yaml documents in a single file.
```
yq -s '"data-" + $index' data.yml
yq -i '.key3="value3"' data-1.yml
yq m -x -d'*' data-0.yml data-1.yml
```

**Additionals**
Version of yq: 4.30.6
Operating system: linux
Installed via: binary release
